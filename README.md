Fan-made card database website for the Lycee Overture Japanese Collectible Card Game by SILVERBLITZ. Built with Laravel and VueJS.

This card game is not available in English, so this project involves translation of Japanese text on the cards using a combination of automated pattern matching-based translation and the also the manual translation efforts thanks to our community members.
