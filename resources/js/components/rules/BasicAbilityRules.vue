        <h2>The Stack</h2>

        <p>
            When Player A declares an action (eg. summoning, attacking, Events, abilities etc.), Player B can declare his Events or abilities in response (which Player A can further declare in response). This creates what is known as the Stack. The Stack is resolved in reverse order of declaration (first in last out).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>You cannot declare an action against your own declaration.</li>
            <li>Basic Abilities and Support can be declared against other declarations.</li>
            <li>
                Some abilities and Events have yellow wordings which indicate targets of effects.<br />
                These targets must be determined on declaration.
            </li>
        </ul>
